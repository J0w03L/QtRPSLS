# py-QtRPSLS
A cross-platform, graphical implementation of "Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock" that I wrote for a university assignment, using Python and Qt.

I was graded A+ for this implementation; I'm pretty happy with how it turned out.

An explanation of what this game is can be found around here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_paper_scissors#Additional_weapons
